# Leetcode-100.-Same-Tree
# 🌳 Same Tree Checker

This project implements a simple and efficient algorithm to determine if **two binary trees are structurally identical** and have the **same node values**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given two binary trees `p` and `q`, return `true` if they are **the same**, or `false` otherwise.

---

## 🔍 What Does "Same Tree" Mean?

- The two trees are **structurally identical** (same shape).
- Each pair of corresponding nodes has the **same value**.

---

## 💡 Approach

The solution uses a **recursive** strategy:

1. ✅ If both nodes are `nullptr`, they are identical at this level.
2. ❌ If only one is `nullptr`, or the values are different, the trees are not the same.
3. 🔁 Recursively compare left and right subtrees.

## 📦 Features

- Simple and clean recursion.
- Efficient with O(n) time complexity (visits each node once).
- Easy to understand and extend.
